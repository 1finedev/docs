## 1. Access the Sandbox Environment

The sandbox environment is your playground for testing integrations without affecting production data. It mirrors the production environment but doesn't persist any operations.

- **Sandbox URL**: `https://sandbox.api.blaac.com`
- **Note**: Always use the sandbox URL for initial testing and development.

## 2. Obtain Your API Keys

To authenticate your requests to the Blaac API, you'll need to generate API keys from your dashboard.

1. Log in to your Blaac account and navigate to the **Dashboard**.
2. Go to the **API Keys** section.
3. Click **Generate New Key**.
4. Copy the generated API key. This will be used to authenticate your requests.

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure. Never expose them in client-side code or public
  repositories.
</Warning>

## 3. Make Your First API Request

With your API key in hand, you're ready to make your first API request. Here's an example using different programming languages:
