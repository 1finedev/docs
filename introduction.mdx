## Best Practices

Follow these best practices to optimize your API usage:

- **Rate Limiting**: Adhere to rate limits to prevent throttling.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust mechanisms to manage API errors and failures.
- **Security**: Protect your API keys and tokens, ensuring all requests are made over HTTPS.
- **Versioning**: Use the appropriate API version to maintain compatibility with future updates.

## Important Considerations

Before you start integrating, keep these key points in mind:

- **Environment Setup**: Ensure your development environment is configured correctly, including API keys, secrets, and base URLs.
- **Sandbox vs. Production**: Use our sandbox environment for testing purposes before going live in production.
- **Rate Limits**: Exceeding rate limits may result in temporary bans. Monitor your usage to stay within limits.
- **Deprecation Notices**: Stay informed about deprecated features and endpoints to avoid disruptions.
- **Support**: Access our support channels for troubleshooting and assistance during your integration.
